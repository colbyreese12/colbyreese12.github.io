            </h2>
            <p>I am passionate about programming and developing software,
            and would like to pursue those interests in a career whether 
            it be game design or software development. I want to design
            programs/software/games that can be used by somebody else as
            a form of entertainment or useful application.

                    Although the communal bathrooms are cleaned daily during the week, some bathrooms tend to get dirtie/messier than others,
                    and because of this, it makes it very hard to determine which bathrooms are cleaner than others and better to use.

                    An affinity diagram representing the possible implications of a mobile app being created in relation to my problem statement.
                    It considers ideas such as how the user will provide feedback, who will be able to use, some basic features of it, etc.

                    There are three sketches with one consisting of a general look for the app, one
                    being a scenario when a student uses the app, and one being when a custodian uses
                    the app.
