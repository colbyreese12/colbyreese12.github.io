                About me
            </h2>
            <p>I am passionate about programming and developing software,
            and would like to pursue those interests in a career whether 
            it be game design or software development. I want to design
            programs/software/games that can be used by somebody else as
            a form of entertainment or useful application.

                    Although the communal bathrooms are cleaned daily during the week, they aren't cleaned on weekends,
                    and thus become dirty very quickly.
